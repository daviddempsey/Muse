# Muse (Demo)

Over quarantine, it’s become increasingly difficult to interact with new people. 

Most of us are now stuck inside almost all day and our social circles have gotten smaller as a result. There simply just isn’t the opportunity to go out and meet new people anymore. However, if there’s one thing that people are doing even more now in quarantine, it’s listening to music. Music, to many, is a defining feature of one's personality. It’s a way for people to express their emotions, their thoughts, and generally, express themselves. It’s also a great way to bring people closer together. For example, have you ever met someone with a very similar music taste to you and you knew that you would be good friends right off the bat? Or have you ever met someone with very different music taste to your own and realized that you have conflicting personalities? Music is an arbiter of connections between individuals. 

Knowing this, my team and I wanted to create a way to bring people together through music. For a class project, we created Muse, a social network designed to connect people based off of their similar music tastes. Muse uses listening data and a unique algorithm to help users meet other people in their area or around the world with similar musical interests. With just the click of a button, users will be able to see a ranked list of people with similar music tastes and easily connect with them through their profile. Try Muse today and see which people you harmonize with the most!
